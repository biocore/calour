class RatioExperiment(Experiment):
    '''This class stores log-ratio data and corresponding analysis methods.

    This is a child class of :class:`.Experiment`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix
        The log-ratio table for OTUs or ASVs.
        Samples are in rows and features in columns
        Note: values can be negative or np.nan as this is log-ratio.
        np.nan indicates ratio is not applicable between 2 samples for a feature.
    sample_metadata : pandas.DataFrame
        The metadata on the samples
    feature_metadata : pandas.DataFrame
        The metadata on the features
    description : str
        name of experiment
    sparse : bool
        store the data array in :class:`scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`
        or :class:`numpy.ndarray`
    databases: iterable of str, optional
        database interface names to show by default in heatmap() function
        by default use 'dbbact'

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix
        The log ratio table for OTUs or ASVs.
        Samples are in row and features in column. values are float (can be negative)
        with np.nan indicating ratio for the specific feature does not exist.
    sample_metadata : pandas.DataFrame
        The metadata on the samples
    feature_metadata : pandas.DataFrame
        The metadata on the features
    shape : tuple of (int, int)
        the dimension of data
    sparse : bool
        store the data as sparse matrix (scipy.sparse.csr_matrix) or dense numpy array.
    info : dict
        information about the experiment (data md5, filenames, etc.)
    description : str
        name of the experiment
    databases : dict
        keys are the database names (i.e. 'dbbact' / 'gnps')
        values are the database specific data for the experiment (i.e. annotations for dbbact)

        '''Create a RatioExperiment object from two groups of samples in an experiment.

        ratios are calculated for each unique value of common_field. For each such value, 2 groups of samples (group1/group2) are created by selecting all samples with value1/value2
        in the group_field. The ratio for the common field value for each feature is calculated by taking the log2 of mean(group1)/mean(group2) for the feature.

        Parameters
        ----------
        exp: calour.Experiment
            The experiment to take the 2 groups of samples from.
        common_field: str
            Name of the sample metadata field to calculate the ratio within.
            For example, to calculate the ratio between 2 timepoints (e.g. before and after treatment) for each subject,
            common_field would be something like 'subject_id'.
        group_field: str
            Name of the sample metadata field on which to divide samples to 2 groups for ratio calculation.
            For example, to calculate the ratio between before and after treatment for each individual,
            group_field with be 'treatment' that has 'before_treatment' and 'after_treatment'.
        value1 : str or iterable of str
            Values for field that will be assigned to the first (nominator) sample group. For example 'before_treatment'.
            If more than one sample matches value1 in field group_field (for a given common_field value), use the mean of the frequency
            (of each feature) as the nominator value for the sample group.
        value2: str or iterable of str, default=None
            If not None, values for field that will be assigned to the second (denominator) sample group. For example 'after_treatment'
            If None, use all samples not in the first sample group as the second sample group.
            Similar to value1, if more than 1 sample matches, use their mean frequency as the denominator value.
        threshold: float or None, optional
            If not None, assign each data value<threshold to threshold. If both nominator and denominator are < threshold,
            the resulting ratio will assigned be np.nan.
            For example, in an AmpliconExperiment, ratios calculated between low read numbers are not reliable. So it is advised to set threshold to approx. 10
        sample_md_suffix: tuple of (str, str), default=None
            The suffix to add to the ratio experiment for each sample metadata column name, indicating if it is from value1 or value2 group.
            If none, append value1 or value2 to the column name respectively.
            In the ratio experiment, since each sample is the ratio of 2 sample groups, the sample metadata can originate from the first or second group. Therefore
            the 2 values will be stored in 2 columns for each original metadata column.

        Returns
        -------
        RatioExperiment
            The samples are all the unique values of common_field (that have >= 1 sample matching value1 and value2 in group_field).
            The data values for each feature are the ratio of mean data values in samples of value1 in
            group_field / data values in samples of value2 in group_field
            sample_metadata contains two columns for each original sample_metadata column: the value for group1 and for group2
            The index for each ratio sample is the index of the group1 sample
